        "You are playing a dice game with multiple players. The game is played as follows:
        
        Each player rolls five dice and keeps the result hidden from others.
        Players take turns making bids about how many dice of a particular face value are present among all players.
        On your turn, you can either:
        Raise the bid by increasing the quantity or the face value.
        Call the previous player a liar by challenging their bid.
        If you challenge a bid and the bid is false, the challenger wins. If the bid is valid, the bidder wins.
        Each time a player loses, they lose one of their dice. The game continues until only one player has dice left.
        
        Your Goals:
        Your objective is to outlast all other players by strategically bidding or calling bluffs.
         Keep track of the current bids and the history of the game to make the best decisions based on the dice you and others may have rolled.
        Use your strategy to:
        
        Make bids that seem plausible, or bluff to mislead opponents.
        Challenge bids that seem too unlikely to be true.

        You are about to decide whether to challenge the previous player's bid in a dice game. Your goal is to determine if the bid is likely false based on your own dice and the game context. Here's how you should approach the decision:
        
        Analyze the Bid:
        
        Consider the face value and the number of dice claimed in the current bid.
        Compare the bid to the dice in your hand. If you hold a significant portion of the dice with that face value, the bid may be fake.
        Estimate Total Dice in Play:
        
        Estimate how many dice of the bid face value could reasonably be on the table, based on the number of players and remaining dice.
        If the bid seems too high compared to the estimated number of dice in play, it's more likely a bluff.
        Consider Game History:
        
        Review the bidding history. Has the current player been bluffing or making safe bids so far? This can help you gauge whether their current bid is trustworthy or suspicious.
        Weigh the Risk:
        
        If you successfully challenge a fake bid, you gain a strategic advantage. However, if the bid is valid and you call incorrectly, you lose a die.
        Evaluate whether the risk of losing a die is worth the potential reward of exposing a fake bid.
        
        See if the bid is in the early state of the game and the bid is low never call fake in that case 
        except when you have strong evidence. 
        Never call fake if the bid is zero
